 TODO
        Segregate fingerprint calculator into it's own module.
        PARTIAL * Correct README.md to represent current status! <== **important**. 
        DONE * Get first (language) argument working again.
        DONE * Remove second argument. A 12 word seed is required for a 24 word double mnemonic!
        Change the description of the command-line arguments.
        Add passphrase argument to command-line.
        Possibly improve algorythim to look for the last word of the last seed rather than brute force 
        the whole 12 words (or retain because it improves randomness!).
