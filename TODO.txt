        Segregate fingerprint calculator into it's own module.
        Correct README.md to represent current status! <== **important**.
        Remove second argument. It must always have a seed word length 12 for a 24 word double mnemonic!
        Change the description of the command-line arguments.
        Possibly improve algorythim to look for the last word of the last seed rather than brute force 
        the whole 12 words (or retain because it improves randomness!).
